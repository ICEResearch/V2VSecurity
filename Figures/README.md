List of final figures used in the magazine article and how to generate them:

    (Figure 1 - Equivocation Rate: This figure was not generated by us, but
                was likely made by Dr. Harrison)

    (Figure 2 & 3 - Tx/Rx Block Diagram: This figure was also not generated by u,
                and was likely made by Dr. Rice)

    Figure 4 - Map of Channel Measurement Routes: This figure was made using
                Google Maps and a photo editor. No source data is stored here.

    Figure 5 - V2I Secrecy Capacity Plot:
                * Generated in V2IGraph.m
                * Used Test Point A - mid 32 .mat 
                * SNR was 1000
                (Note that MDR likely has a version that he worked his magic
                    on to make it look nicer)

    Figure 6 - V2I Coded Equivocation Plot:
                * Generated in codedV2I.m
                * K = 50, corresponding to the threshold (?)
                (Note that running this file makes my laptop sad)

    Figure 7 - V2I Equivocation, Eve, Coded & Uncoded: 
                    

    Figure 8 - V2V Secrecy Capacity Plot: (Gaussian_case.m?)
                * Plotted using 'V2VSecrecyCapacity.mat' (likely this .mat file
                    was passed to Dr. Rice so he could make it look nice)
                    This file was generated with MakeV2VSecCapGraph.m
                * SNR of 15.31
                (Note that gaussian_case.m will generate a variety of these at 
                    different SNR values)

    Figure 9 - V2V Equivocation, Eve, Coded & Uncoded:
                * Uncoded was made in threshold_method.m using data generated
                    in GenerateAveragedData with a length of 41
                    This also produced dataForCodedCase.mat
                * Coded was generated in codedV2V.m using dataForCodedCase.mat
                * SNR of 15.31 (SNR Index 16) was used
                (Note that figure 9 was the uncoded and coded cases on top of
                    eachother, which we did not generate ourselves)
